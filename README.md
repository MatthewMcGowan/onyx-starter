##### Dashboard

If you would like to use the [Onyx
Dashboard](https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx-dashboard) to inspect the
cluster, download the
[uberjar](https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx-dashboard/#deployment).

In core.clj evaluate the sample file bit by bit, as above.

After evaluating the line: 
`(def env (onyx.api/start-env env-config))`
start the dashboard by:

`ZOOKEEPER_ADDR="127.0.0.1:2188" java -jar onyx-dashboard-VERSION-NUMBER.jar`
